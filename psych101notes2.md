## Consciousness

**Definition**

* Awareness of ourselves, our current environment, and mental processes. 
* Only accessible through conscious subject's viewpoint. 

### Waking Consciousness

A state of clear, organized alertness. 

**Selective attention**: our ability to focus our awareness on some stimuli to the exclusion of others. **Inattentional blindness**.

**Two ways of approaching waking activities**

* Automatic processing: carrying out activities without conscious attention to them.
* Controlled processing: carrying out activities with a conscious effort to direct them. 

**Daydreaming**: form of mental drifting, effective way to rehearse goals and explore solutions to problems. Occurs when a person is engaged in a task that doesn't require full attention. 

### Lack of Awareness

**Subliminal Perception**: The idea that perception of stimuli without awareness can influence behavior. Has a modest effect on behavior. Doesn't influence behavior as claimed.

**Sleep**

### Sleep

**Stages:**

* NREM - quiet sleep
	* Stage 1: Show irregular brain waves (theta) and alpha. 
		* Wake up easily.
		* Experience hallucinations: dream-like images.
		* Hypnic jerk: body twitches as one falls asleep. 
		* Lasts about several minutes.
	* Stage 2: Brain waves slow and show sleep spindles.
		* More difficult to awaken. 
		* Lasts about 20 minutes. 
	* Slow Wave Sleep (SWS Stages 3&4)
		* Brain waves show large proportion of delta waves. (0-4 Hz)
		* Skeletal muscles relax and person difficult to awaken. 
		* Lasts about 20-25 minutes.
		* Release of growth hormones and restores body. 
* REM (Rapid Eye Movements), aka Paradoxical Sleep - active sleep
	* Brain activity resembles waking EEG.
	* Increased heart rate and respiration.
	* Genitals become aroused.
	* Show rapid eye movements.
	* Experience vivid dreams.
	* Paralysis of skeletal muscles. 

**Nightly Sleeping Cycle** Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> SWS -> Stage 2 -> REM 1 -> Stage 2 -> SWS -> Stage 2 -> REM 2 -> ...

As time goes, SWS decreases, REM increases. 

**Sleep over the life span**

* Infants and children 
	* Spend longest time sleeping. Infants ~ 16hr a day; children 8-10hr. 
	* Show greater percentage of slow wave sleep. 
* Young adults
	* Sleep 7-8 hours a night.
	* 20% is spent in REM. 
* Elderly auldts
	* Sleep 6 hours a night.
	* 15% is spent in REM. 
	* Slow wave sleep decreases from 30-50 years of age. 

The older we get, the less we sleep and less time is spent in REM and slow wave sleep. 

**Sleep disorders and disturbances**

* Insomnia 失眠: chronic inability to get sufficient sleep.
	* Three types:
		* Difficulty falling asleep.
		* Awakens easily and can't go back to sleep.
		* Awakens briefly and frequently. 
	* Women suffer from insomnia more than men.
	* Treatment: 1) sleeping pills; 2) natural remedies.
* Narcolepsy 发作性嗜睡病: irresistible sleep attacks during the day. 
	* Triggered by intense emotions.
	* Cataplexy: loss of voluntary muscle control.
	* Enter directly into REM.
	* Inability to produce hypocretin.
	* Treatment: stimulants and antidepressants.
* Sleep Apnea 睡眠呼吸暂停: temporary failure of breathing during sleep. 
	* Abnormally in the medulla, blockage of air passages.
	* Treatments: 
		* CPAP mask.
		* Weight loss.
		* Tongue guard.
		* Surgery. 
* Night terrors 夜惊: sudden arousal from sleep and extreme panic.
	* Crying and increased respiration.
	* Occurs during SWS/transitions between stages. 
	* No memory of event.
	* Usually occurs in children.
	* Triggers: stress, overtired, sleep deprivation, heredity.
* REM Behavior Disorder (RBD) 快速眼动期行为失调: No paralysis of muscles during REM.
	* Person acts out his/her dreams
	* Problem with the brain stem. 
	* May be an early sign of Parkinson's disease and other degenerative diseases.
	* Can be treated with medication. 
	* Important to maintain environmental safety. 
* Sleep Walking (Somnambulism) 梦游
	* Occurs during slow wave sleep.
	* Runs in families.
	* Most common in children and during times of stress. 
* Sleep Talking 
	* Ranges from a grunt to clear sentences.
	* Occurs mostly in NREM (can occur during REM)

### Dreams

* Nature of dreams
	* Characteristic features
		* Intense emotions: increased limbic system activity (Amygdala)
		* Illogical content: prefrontal cortex is shut down
		* Hallucinations: discrepancy between dream events and body feedback
		* Delusional content: uncritical acceptance of dream experience
		* Amnesia
	* REM vs NREM Dreams
		* NREM dreams: more thought-oriented and less visual imagery, associated with more positive emotions
		* REM dreams: more bizarre, more visual imagery, more narrative, action-oriented, and are associated with negative emotions. 
		* Lucid dreams: occur during REM and involve the dreamer becoming aware that he/she is dreaming. Can be intentionally induced. Brain areas not typically active during REM are active during lucid dreaming (prefrontal cortex).
		* Nightmares: occur during REM, easily remembered, triggered by stress and traumatic event. Often occur late at night during the longest period of REM. 
* Dream Content
	* Focus on events and people we come in contact with.
	* Reflect our daytime experiences and our emotional state. 
* Functions of Dreams
	* Dreams as "precognition"
		* Belief that dreams can foretell the future
		* Anecdotal evidence (Lincoln)
		* Most can be dismissed as coincidence or hindsight bias
		* Many reflect unconscious feeling or sentiment about a situation that you later dream about.
	* Freud: Dreams as "Wish Fulfillment"
		* Dreams guard sleep by disguising disruptive thoughts with symbols.
			* Manifest content: surface narrative
			* Latent content: hidden deeper meaning
			* Symbolism: objects and actions are transformed to other less threatening objects and actions.
	* Cognitive view
		* We dream about our current concerns.
		* Dream as a means of problem solving: Elias Howe, Einstein.
		* Dreams release us from a mental set.
		* Dreams represent aspects of memory processing.
			* REM up, retention up.
			* Same areas active during learning and REM.
			* Increased hippocampal activity during REM.
	* Activation Synthesis Theory
		* Represent a person's interpretation of random brain activity during REM.  
			* Amygdala active during REM (intensive emotions).
			* Visual association areas are active.
			* Activity random -> bizarre content. 

## Learning

A relatively permanaent change in behavior that occurs because of experience. 	

**Antecedents** Events that precede a behavior and influence it.
**Consequences** Events that follow a behavior and determine if that behavior will be repeated. 

### Conditioning

Learning that involves associations stimuli and responses. 

* Classical Conditioning: focuses on antecedents that influence a response. 
* Operant Conditioning: Focuses on consequences that influence a response. 

**Basic Terminology**
Antecedents --(Classical)--> Behavior <--(Operant)-- Consequences

#### Classical Conditioning

**Pavlov's Observations**

* Put food in a dog's mouth, it will begin to salivate (innate response). Stimulus (food) -> Response (salivation)
* Soon the dog would salivate to different stimuli (learned response). S (dog dish) -> R (salivation), S(foot steps) -> R(salivation)

**Pavlov Study on Learning**

* Before learning: 
		* S (food) -> R (salivation)
		* S (tone) -> No response
* After learning
		* S (tone) -> R (salivation)

**Classical Conditioning Terminology**

* Unconditioned Stimulus (US) 
	* Example: food.
* Unconditioned Response (UR) 
	* Example: Salivation to food.
* Conditioned Stimulus (CS) / Neutral Stimulus (NS)
	* Example: Bell. 
* Conditioned Response (CR) 
	* Example: Salivation to bell. 

**Principles of Classical Conditioning**

* **Higher-order conditioning**: When a NS can become a CS by being paired with an already established CS. (Light -> Bell -> Salivation ===> Light -> Salivation)
* **Extinction**: Weakening/disappearance of the CR through repeated presentations of the CS without the US.
* **Spontaneous Recovery**: Reappearance of an extinguished response in a weaker form following a rest periods. Show that learned associations aren't totally forgotten. 
* **Generalization**: When one develops a CR to a stimulus that is similar to the original CS. Ensures that we expand learning beyond the immediate CS. 
* **Discrimination**: The process by which an organism learns to respond only to a specific stimulus. Guarantees that we don't generalize too broadly. 

**Real life applications**

* Conditioning positive emotions
	* Plays an important role in our emotional responses to objects, symbols, events, and places. 
	* Used in advertising. 
* Conditioning negative emotions
	* Many phobias are a result of conditioning.
	* Environmental cues associated with drug use -> cravings. 
	* Taste aversions (Garcia effect).

**Factors that influence conditioning**

* How reliably the CS predict the US
	* The more reliable the CS, the greater the CR. 
* Number of pairing of the CS and the US
	* The greater the number of pairings, the stronger the CR. 
	* Exceptions: Taste aversions and responses to trauma. 
* Intensity of the US
	* The stronger the intensity of the US, the stronger the CR. 
* Temporal relationship between SC and US
	* Conditioning is fastest if CS occurs shortly before US. 

#### Operant Conditioning

Thorndike (Puzzle box)

**Low of effect** Positive consequences increase behavior, negative consequences decrease behavior. 

**Reinforcement**: increases behavior in the future. 

Types of reinforcement

* Positive reinforcement: strengthening a behavior by adding something positive to the situation. 
	* Example: 
		* Behavior: making the bed in the morning. 
		* Presentation of positive stimulus: you receive praise for making the bed. 
		* Frequency of behavior increases: you make the bed in the future. 
* Negative reinforcement: Strengthening a behavior by removing something negative (positive consequence). 
	* Example: air-conditioner / umbrella. 
	* Example: 
		* Behavior: taking a pain reliever.
		* Removal of a negative stimulus: headache goes away. 
		* Frequency of behavior increases: you take pain relievers in the future. 

**Punishment**: decreases behavior in the future. 

Types of punishment: 

* **Aversive (Positive) Punishment**: Adding something negative to decrease a behavior. 
	* Example: 
		* Behavior: touch a hot iron.
		* Presentation of a negative stimulus: your hand gets burnt
		* Frequency of behavior decreases: not to touch not irons in the future. 
* **Response Cost (Negative Punishment)**: The removal of something positive in order to decrease behavior (negative consequence).
	* Example:
		* Behavior: Coming home after curfew.
		* Removal of a pleasant stimulus: losing driving privileges/
		* Frequency of behavior decreases: not come home after curfew in the future. 

**Problems with punishment**

* May decrease undesired behavior, but doesn't automatically increase desired behavior.
* Fear and anxiety may become associated with the punisher and environment. 
* Punisher must pay attention to the offender; attention can be reinforcing. 
* Provides a model of aggressive behavior.

<tr><td></td><td>Stimulus Added <br>(Positive)</td><td>Stimulus Removed <br>(Negative)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Response increased <br>(Reinforcement)</td><td>Positive Reinforcement</td><td>Negative Reinforcement</td></tr>
<tr><td>Response decreased<br>(Punishment)</td><td>Aversive Punishment</td><td>Response Cost</td></tr>
</table>

**Shaping**

* Reinforcing behaviors that successively approximate a desired response. 
* Reward one step at a time. 

**Superstitious Behavior**

Behavior that is learned through a coincidental association with reinforcement. 

**Reinforcement Schedules**

* **Continuous reinforcement**: reinforcement given on every trial. 
	* Continuous reinforced behaviors are easily extinguished. 
* **Partial reinforcement**: reinforcement only part of the time. 
	* Partially reinforced behaviors are more resistant to extinction. 
	* **Types**: 
		* Number of responses (ratio)
			* Fixed ratio schedule: reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses. (Copy cards, buy one get one free)
			* Variable ratio schedule: reinforcement occurs after a variable number of responses. (Lottery, gambling)
		* Passage of time (interval)
			* Fixed interval schedule: reinforcement occurs after a specified period of time has passed since the previous reinforcer. (Salary, exams)
			* Variable interval schedule: reinforcement occurs after a varying period of time has passed since the previous reinforcer. (Waiting for a text message reply, fishing)

**Classical vs. Operant Conditioning**

<table>
<tr>
<th>Characteristic</th><th>Classical</th><th>Operant</th>

<tr>
<td>Type of association</td><td>Between 2 stimuli</td><td>Between a response and its consequence</td>

<tr>
<td>State of the subject</td><td>Passive</td><td>Active</td>

</tr>
</table>

Operant and classical conditioning can be combined, such as avoidance learning. 

#### Observational Learning

Observational learning focuses on the role of thought in establishing and maintaining behavior. 

**Albert Bandura's Studies**

Confirmed that people learn through observing and imitating the behavior of others.
