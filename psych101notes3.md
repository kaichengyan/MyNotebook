## Motivation

### Defining motivation

* Reflects an internal condition.
* Initiates, activates and maintains behavior.
* Generates goal directed behavior.

#### Drive Theory 动机理论

Organisms strive to reduce their needs and drives. 

* Need: A state of physiological imbalance or internal deficiency. 
* Drive: Aroused motivational state that directs an organism to satisfy a physiological need. 

Biological need (need for food, water, oxygen) - Arises from an imbalance.
|
Drive state (hunger, thirst, suffocation) - Triggers goal directed behavior.
|
Activation of different behaviors (eating, drinking, gasping)
|
Behaviors that reduce drive are STRENGTHENED, 
Behaviors that don't reduce drive are WEAKENED. 

Needs and drives are NOT the same thing, because their respenctive strengths can differ. 

**Homeostasis 体内平衡**: Body's tendency to maintain a balanced internal state. Goal is to maintain equilibrium.

**Incentives 激励**: External motivating forces that pull us toward certain actions. 

##### Types of motives

* **Primary motives**: those based on innate biological needs necessary for survival. 
* **Stimulus motives**: needs for stimulation and acquisition of knowledge; appear innate but aren't necessary for survival. 
* **Secondary motives**: learned needs, drives and goals. 

#### Arousal Theory 唤醒理论

Organism seek to maintain an optimal level of arousal. 

If arousal < optimal, we increase arousal. 
If arousal > optimal, we decrease arousal. 

Arousal is the activation of the body and nervous system. 

>0=death, 
>low=sleep, 
>moderate=normal activity, 
>high=excitement/panic. 

Most people perform best when arousal is moderate.  

**Yerkes-Dodson Law** Performance on tasks is best when arousal level is appropriate to the difficulty of the task. 

* Easy task -> higher arousal. (skews toward higher arousal)
* Difficult task -> lower arousal. (skews toward lower arousal)

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Organized human motives and suggested that lower needs must be fulfilled before higher levels. 

```no-highlight
Growth needs: concerned with positive, life-enhancing forces for personal growth. 
          / Self-actuali-  \
         /   zation needs   \
        /   Aesthetic needs  \
       /    Cognitive needs   \
Deficiency needs: concerned with physical and social survival.
     /      Esteem needs        \
    /Belongingness and Love Needs\
   /         Safety needs         \
  /       Physiological needs      \
```

* A single activity can have different motivations for different people. 
* People spend so much time focusing on lower needs, they often feel unfulfilled. 
* Flaw: sometimes higher needs take priority over lower needs. 

### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation

* **Intrinsic motivation**: motivation to engage in a behavior for its own sake. 
* **Extrinsic motivation**: motivation based on the rewards and punishments the behavior may bring; strongly tied to principles of learning. 

Does a combination of motivations lead to more effective performance in a task? 

**Overjustification effect**: A decline in intrinsic motivation as a result of giving too much extrinsic motivation. Mainly applies to physical rewards (i.e. money), not to praise. 

### Hunger

#### Brain Mechanisms of Hunger

**Lateral Hypothalamus (LH)**

* Feeding center: initates eating behavior. 
* Stimulation/activation of LH starts eating. 
* Destruction/damage of LH cause an animal to starve. 

**Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH)**

* Satiety center: stops eating behavior. 
* Stimulation/activation of VMH stops eating. 
* Destruction/damage of VMH causes an animxal to eat continuously.

**Paraventricular Nucleus**

* Helps regulate blood sugar by stimulating and reducing appetite.
* Neuropeptide Y stimulates hunger. 
* Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) ceases eating. 

#### Eating Disorders

* **Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa**
	* Both disorders involve an irrational fear of gaining weight and distorted body image.
	* **Anorexia Nervosa**
		* Active self-starvation that has psychological origins
		* Excessive exercise
		* Purging behavior
		* Body weight: below 85% of normal for one's height
		* Absence of menstrual periods
		* Decreased blood pressure, decreased gray matter in the brain, and impaired heart function
	* **Bulimia Nervosa**
		* Binge eating followed by purging
		* Body weight: normal to above normal weight
		* Lack of control over eating
		* Accompanied by depression
		* Physical problems: dehydration, kidney damage, hair loss, acid reflux, irregular heart beat, abnormal bowel function, and tooth decay.
	* Risk factors for developing Anorexia/Bulimia
		* Women outnumber men
		* Most common in western cultures which cultivate a desire for thinness
		* Teens and young adults
		* Professionals whose weight is related to achievement
	* Possible causes for Anorexia/Bulimia
		* Physiological Causes
			* Malfunction of hypothalamus? **No support**
			* Hormone levels: A type of estrogen may play a role in triggering eating disorders during puberty.
			* Serotonin levels: High serotonin activity associated with anorexia; low serotonin activity related to bulimia (depression is also associated with low serotonin).
		* Psychological Causes
			* Conflict with over protective parents
			* A type of obsessive compulsive disorder
				* Obsessed with food
				* Engage in compulsive behavior to deal with the obsession
			* Fear of the adult world and sexual relationships
			* Perfectionism -> self-hatred -> low self-esteem
			* Societal pressures
	* Treatment for Anorexia and Bulimia
		* Pharmacological Treatments
			* Antipsychotic drugs used to treat compulsive disorder
			* Antidepressants used to treat Bulimia
		* Psychological Treatments
			* Psychotherapy
			* In-patient treatment centers
			* Cognitive behavior therapy to treat Bulimia
* **Obesity**
	* Why do people become obese?
		* Emotional Disturbances: Anxiety -> Over-eating -> Weight-gain -> Anxiety
		* Genetic Factors
			* Obesity runs in families
			* Weight of adopted children correlates more with the weight of biological parents
			* Researchers located an obesity gene in mice
				* Two types of genetically obese mice
					* Lack of leptin receptors in VMH
					* Lack of leptin (OB mice)
					* Body fat -> leptin -> leptin receptors in VMH -> Adjust appetite and metabolism -> body fat. 
		* Obesity likely due to an interaction between generics and environment.

### Emotion

#### Components of Emotion

* Physiological component
	* Physiological arousal that accompanies emotion
	* Many reactions are controlled by the autonomic nervous system
		* Sympathetic system activates body for fight/flight
		* Parasympathetic system reverses emotional arousal
	* Limbic system (especially the amygdala) play a role in emotion
* Cognitive component
	* Our perceptions and interpretations of a stimulus or situation determine the emotions we feel
	* Emotional responses to imaginary threats are as real as those to real threats
* Behavioral component
	* Outward expression of emotions (gestures, facial expressions, tone of voice, etc.)
	* Some emotional expressions are innate
		* Ekman and Friesen Study
			* People from all cultures are able to identify the emotional expressions for the basic emotions
			* Context helps determine the emotion being displayed
	* Display rules
		* Cultural rules that dictate how emotions are expressed and when and where they are appropriate
		* Much of the emotion displayed is not authentic (service industry)

#### Theories of Emotion

* **James-Lange Theory**
	* An event causes physiological arousal
	* The arousal then determines the emotion
	* Example: Sight of oncoming car -> pounding heart -> fear
* **Cannon-Bard Theory**
	* Emotional feelings and bodily arousal occur independently
	* One does not cause the other
	* Example: Sight of oncoming car activates thalamus -> cortex produces emotional feeling, internal organs trigger arousal
* **Schachter-Singer Two-factor Theory**
	* Emotion depends on two factors:
		* Physiological arousal
		* Cognitive interpretation of he arousal based on environmental cues (Why do I feel as I do?)

## Development

### Infant Development

#### Abilities of Newborns

* **Newborns' reflexes**
	* Babinski Reflex: Fanning out of toes in repsonse to a touch on the sole of a foot
	* Grasping Reflex: Vigorous grasp of any object that touches the hand or fingers
	* Rooting Reflex: Turning the head and opening the mouth otward light touch on lips or cheek.
	* Sucking Reflex: Rhythmic sucking in response to placing finger or nipple in infants mouth.
	* Moro Reflex: Outstretching of arms and legs in response to a loud sound or abrupt change in environment. 
	* Initially these abilities are biologically determined.
	* Gradually learned responses replace reflexive reactions.

#### Infant Perception

* Visual Preferences (Robert Fantz)
	* Infants prefer to look at patterns over solids
	* Favorite pattern was the human face (social reflex important to survival)
* Infant Imitation (Meltzoff and Moore)
	* Infants can imitate facial gestures
	* Not believed to hit this milestone until 8-12 months
	* Infants as young as 72 hours old can imitate facial expressions
	* Supports the idea that infants may be born with a social reflex
* Cross Modal Matching (Meltzoff and Borton)
	* The ability to identify an object only experience in one modality by using another
	* Infants as young as 12 hours old can engage in cross modal matching
	* Infants can form mental representations
* Auditory Preferences
	* Infants prefer mothers' voice over other voices
	* Newborns can recognize passages read in utero
* Sensitive to Number
	* Babies have been shown to comprehend number

#### Maturation

* The unfolding of genetically programmed processes of growth and development over time.
* Process can be derailed without proper input from the environment.

**Motor Development**

* Requires no training but follows a fixed sequence
* Each stage serves as a foundation for subsequent stages
* Rate of acquisition may vary, but the sequence is the same

**Social Development**

* Self-awareness
	* Being aware of oneself as a separate person
	* Self-recognition Mirror Test (Rouge Test)
	* Self-awareness depends on matureation of the brain, particularly development of areas within the frontal lobes
	* Develops between 15-18 months
* Attachment
	* Refers to the enduring social-emotional relationship between a child and primary caregiver
	* Types of attachment
		* Secure attachment: positive and secure bond 60-70%
			* Secure with parent
			* Distressed by separation
			* Delighted by reunion
		* Ambivalent attachment: Insecure emotional bond 10%
			* Fearful and clingy
			* Distressed by separation
			* Seeks and rejects contact
		* Avoidant attachment: Insecure emotional bond 15-20%
			* Little attachment to parent
			* Seldom cries by separation
			* Avoids contact upon return
	* What determines attachment?
		* Parental responsiveness to baby's needs
			* Sensitive responsive parenting -> secure
			* Emotionally unavailable parenting -> insecure
	* Contact comfort
		* Innate pleasure derived from close physical constact
		* Is the basis of an infant's first attachment
		* Harlow: Attachment in monkeys
			* Baby monkeys always clung to terry-cloth mother for comfort, not to the one with food
			* Although the cloth mother provided some security, it wasn't enough for satisfactory social development
				* Aggressive with other monkeys
				* Showed bizarre sexual behavior
				* Neglected/abused their young

**Language Development**

* Stages of language development
	* Cooing Stage
		* Infant produces mainly vowels and can discriinate speech sounds from all human languages
	* Babbling Stage
		* Child produces vocalizations using both consonants and vowels. 
		* Can only discriminate sounds used in own language. 
	* Single-word Stage 1 yr
		* Children begin to use single words to communicate meaning
	* Two-word Stage (Telegraphic speech) 2 yr
		* Child speaks in two word statements, usually consisting of verbs, nouns and adjectives and devoid of non-essential words. 
	
* Theories of Language Development
	* Learning theories
		* Children learn language through operant conditioning (reinforcement and imitation)
	* Nativist Perspective (Chomsky)
		* Ability to learn language is innate
		* **Language acquisition device** interacts with language input to extract appropriate linguistic information.
	* Consensus
		* Language acquisition proceeds according to a developmental timetable that's common to all cultures
		* Language learning involves maturation
		* Exposure to language input must occur during a particular time period for language to develop

* Is there a time limit to learning language?
	* Critical period Hypothesis
		* A person must be exposed to language during a sensitive period for language to develop normally
	* Supporting Evidence for L1 Acquisition
		* Children raised linguistically isolated
			* Wild Children
			* Deaf children born to hearing parents

**Cognitive Development**

Piaget's Theory

* How do children deal with new experiences?
	* Assimilation: Fitting new information into the present system of knowledge, beliefs, and mental schema.
	* Accommodation: The changing of existing schema to accommodate new information that does not fit.
* Stages of Cognitive Development
	* Each stage reflects a different way of reasoning and understanding of the world.
	* Stages occur in a fixed sequence.
	* All children progress through the stages in the same order.
	* Transition between stages is gradual.
	* Sensorimotor Stages (0-2 yrs):
		* Child gains understanding of the world through his/her senses and motor activities.
		* Child lives in the present.
		* **Object Permanence**: knowledge that an object continues to exist when out of sight. 
		* Object permanence develops around 8 months.
	* Preoperational Stage (2-7 yrs):
		* Use of symbols accelerate, rapid language development. able to pretend.
		* Child exhibits **egocentric thinking**; fail false belief test.
		* Child exhibits **centration**: a tendency to focus on only one dimension of a stimulus.
		* Child fails at conservation tasks: Not aware that a given quantity of matter remains the same even after a superficial change in appearance. 
		* Lack reversibility of thought.
	* Concrete Operational Stage (7-12 yrs):
		* Thinking is less egocentric and more logical.
		* Children begin to use concepts of time, space, and number.
		* Child achieves **mastery of conservation**. 
		* Have **decentered thinking** and **reversibility** of thought.
	* Formal Operational (12 yrs - )
		* Able to think abstractly.
		* Use deductive reasoning.
	* Evaluation of Piaget's Theory
		* Pros
			* Cognitive abilities associated with the 4 stages occur in the same orer across cultures.
			* New abilities depend on previous abilities. 
			* Children are active participants in their cognitive development.
		* Cons
			* Piaget underestimated ability of children, especially infants.
				* Object permanence has been shown in 3 months old infants.
				* Meltzoff's work on infant imitation & cross modal matching.
			* Cognitive development depends on social and cultural context.
			* Piaget overestimated the cognitive skills of many adults.

## Personality

### Freud's Theory of Personality

* Three Levels of Awareness
	* Conscious: Whatever a person is aware of at any given moment (like working memory)
	* Preconscious: Contains all memories and experiences that one is not consciously thinking about (like long-term memory)
	* Unconscious: Motivating force of behavior that we are not conscious of
* Structure of Personality
	* Id (Biological Urges)
		* Life instincts: sexual instincts and biological urges
		* Death instincts: aggressive and destructive impulses
		* Pleasure principle: tries to seek pleasure, avoid pain and gain immediate gratification
		* Source of the libido (psychic energy that fuels personality)
	* Ego (Mediator)
		* Logical, rational, realistic part of personality
		* Functions to satisfy Id's urges
		* Mostly conscious
		* **Reality principle**: Tries to bring pleasure within the norms of society
	* Superego (Societal Morals)
		* Moral component of personality
		* **Conscience**: contains all behaviors for which one has been punished for and feels guilty about
		* **Ego ideal**: contains behaviors one has been praised for and feels pride about

Only a part of Ego and a small part of Superego are visible personality.

* Freud: Defense Mechanisms
	* Repression: removes painful memories from consciousness and prevents unconscious impulses from becoming conscious.
	* Regression: retreating to an earlier less threatening stage when unable to deal with anxiety
	* Denial: refusal to admit that something unpleasant has happened
	* Reaction formation: denying an unacceptable impulse or feeling by expressing the opposite
	* Rationalization: supplying a logical rational reason, rather than the real reason for an action or event
	* Displacement: substituting a less threatening object for the orginal object of an impulse
	* Projection: attributing one's own undesirable traits to another person; directs attention away from personal failings
	* Sublimation: acting out an unacceptable impulse in a socially acceptable behavior

* Freud: Psychosexual Stages
	* Each stage centers around a particular **erogenous zone** (part of the body that provides pleasure/conflict)
	* Unresolved conflicts result in **fixation** (emotional hangup caused by overindulgence/frustration)
		* A portion of the libido remains in that stage
		* Personality characteristics arise from difficulty at a particular stage
	* Oral Stage
		* Age: 0 - 12 month
		* Erogenous Zone: Mouth
		* Conflicts/Experiences:
			* Child gains gratification from sucking, eating and biting
			* Conflict centers around weaning
		* **Oral dependent personality** (early): gullible, clingy, passive
		* **Oral aggressive personality** (late): cynical, argumentative, exploitive, and aggressive
	* Anal Stage
		* Age: 1 - 3 yrs
		* Erogenous Zone: Anus
		* Conflicts/Experience:
			* Conflict arises from toilet training
		* **Anal retentive personality**: clean, orderly, and stingy
		* **Anal expulsive personality**: messy, disorganized, destructive
	* Phallic Stage
		* Age: 3 - 6 yrs
		* Erogenous: Genitals
			* Pleasure derived from touching genitals
			* Conflict involves desire for opposite sex parent
		* Oedipus complex - boys; Electra complex - girls
		* **Phallic personality**: flirtatious, vain, promiscuous, narcissistic
	* Latency Stage
		* Age: 6 yrs - puberty
		* Erogenous Zone: none
		* Conflicts/Experiences: School, hobbies, same sex friends
	* Genital Stage
		* Age: Puberty onward
		* Erogenous Zone: Genitals
		* Conflicts/Experiences: Mature sexual relationships

* Evaluation of Freud's Theory
	* First to suggest that experiences in early childhood help shape personality
	* First to propose personality develops in a series of stages
	* First to suggest that unconscious can influence behavior and personality
	* Explanations were misguided
	* Theory is untestable

### Traits Theories of Personality

* Personality Traits
	* Relatively stable characteristics that hellp establish a person's identity.
* Factor Analysis
	* A statistical procedure used to identify clusters of related items
	* Often used to classify traits into different dimensions
* Five Factor Model (Big 5 - OCEAN)
	* **Openness**: Creative/unimaginative, daring/timid, independent/conforming
	* **Conscientiousness**: Reliable/undependable, careful/careless, steadfast/fickle, organized/disorganized
	* **Extroversion**: Outgoing/shy, social/reclusive, talkative/quiet, affectionate/reserved
	* **Agreeableness**: Good-natured/irritable, courteous/rude, flexible/stubborn, cooperative/abrasive
	* **Neuroticism**: Unstable/stable, anxious/calm, insecure/secure, self-pitying/self-satisfied
* How stable are traits?
	* In adulthood these traits are fairly stable.
	* Over a lifetime, some traits are more stable than others.
		* Emotional negativity decreases, conscientiousness increases with age.
* Trait-situation interactions
	* When external events influence how a particular trait is expressed
	* Traits interact with situations to determine behavior
* Are personality traits innate?
	* Minnesota Twins Study
	* Identical twins have many similarities
		* Display similar gesutres
		* Have similar interests and talents
		* Caveat: Fallacy of positive instances
			* Tendency to notice and remember similarities but not differences
		* Conclusion: heredity accounts for 40-50% of the variation on personality traits
* Personality Assessment
	* Objective Personality Tests
		* Objective questionnaires
		* Meausre dimensions of personality
		* Scored using standard procedures
		* Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2)
			* Used to asses personality and to diagnose psychiatric disorders
			* Composted of 567 T/F statements
	* Projective Personality Tests
		* Rorschach Inkblot Test
			* 10 inkblots used to reveal what is in the unconscious
			* Relies on subjective interpretation of the examiner
		* Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
			* Tell a story about 20 ambiguous drawings
			* Relies on interpretation of the examiner
			* Reflects temporary emotional states, not permanent aspects of personality
