## Motivation

### Defining motivation

* Reflects an internal condition.
* Initiates, activates and maintains behavior.
* Generates goal directed behavior.

#### Drive Theory 动机理论

Organisms strive to reduce their needs and drives. 

* Need: A state of physiological imbalance or internal deficiency. 
* Drive: Aroused motivational state that directs an organism to satisfy a physiological need. 

Biological need (need for food, water, oxygen) - Arises from an imbalance.
|
Drive state (hunger, thirst, suffocation) - Triggers goal directed behavior.
|
Activation of different behaviors (eating, drinking, gasping)
|
Behaviors that reduce drive are STRENGTHENED, 
Behaviors that don't reduce drive are WEAKENED. 

Needs and drives are NOT the same thing, because their respenctive strengths can differ. 

**Homeostasis 体内平衡**: Body's tendency to maintain a balanced internal state. Goal is to maintain equilibrium.

**Incentives 激励**: External motivating forces that pull us toward certain actions. 

##### Types of motives

* **Primary motives**: those based on innate biological needs necessary for survival. 
* **Stimulus motives**: needs for stimulation and acquisition of knowledge; appear innate but aren't necessary for survival. 
* **Secondary motives**: learned needs, drives and goals. 

#### Arousal Theory 唤醒理论

Organism seek to maintain an optimal level of arousal. 

If arousal < optimal, we increase arousal. 
If arousal > optimal, we decrease arousal. 

Arousal is the activation of the body and nervous system. 

>0=death, 
>low=sleep, 
>moderate=normal activity, 
>high=excitement/panic. 

Most people perform best when arousal is moderate.  

**Yerkes-Dodson Law** Performance on tasks is best when arousal level is appropriate to the difficulty of the task. 

* Easy task -> higher arousal. (skews toward higher arousal)
* Difficult task -> lower arousal. (skews toward lower arousal)

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Organized human motives and suggested that lower needs must be fulfilled before higher levels. 

```no-highlight
Growth needs: concerned with positive, life-enhancing forces for personal growth. 
          / Self-actuali-  \
         /   zation needs   \
        /   Aesthetic needs  \
       /    Cognitive needs   \
Deficiency needs: concerned with physical and social survival.
     /      Esteem needs        \
    /Belongingness and Love Needs\
   /         Safety needs         \
  /       Physiological needs      \
```

* A single activity can have different motivations for different people. 
* People spend so much time focusing on lower needs, they often feel unfulfilled. 
* Flaw: sometimes higher needs take priority over lower needs. 

### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation

* **Intrinsic motivation**: motivation to engage in a behavior for its own sake. 
* **Extrinsic motivation**: motivation based on the rewards and punishments the behavior may bring; strongly tied to principles of learning. 

Does a combination of motivations lead to more effective performance in a task? 

**Overjustification effect**: A decline in intrinsic motivation as a result of giving too much extrinsic motivation. Mainly applies to physical rewards (i.e. money), not to praise. 

### Hunger

#### Brain Mechanisms of Hunger

**Lateral Hypothalamus (LH)**

* Feeding center: initates eating behavior. 
* Stimulation/activation of LH starts eating. 
* Destruction/damage of LH cause an animal to starve. 

**Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH)**

* Satiety center: stops eating behavior. 
* Stimulation/activation of VMH stops eating. 
* Destruction/damage of VMH causes an animxal to eat continuously.

**Paraventricular Nucleus**

* Helps regulate blood sugar by stimulating and reducing appetite.
* Neuropeptide Y stimulates hunger. 
* Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) ceases eating. 

#### Eating Disorders

* **Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa**
	* Both disorders involve an irrational fear of gaining weight and distorted body image.
	* **Anorexia Nervosa**
		* Active self-starvation that has psychological origins
		* Excessive exercise
		* Purging behavior
		* Body weight: below 85% of normal for one's height
		* Absence of menstrual periods
		* Decreased blood pressure, decreased gray matter in the brain, and impaired heart function
	* **Bulimia Nervosa**
		* Binge eating followed by purging
		* Body weight: normal to above normal weight
		* Lack of control over eating
		* Accompanied by depression
		* Physical problems: dehydration, kidney damage, hair loss, acid reflux, irregular heart beat, abnormal bowel function, and tooth decay.
	* Risk factors for developing Anorexia/Bulimia
		* Women outnumber men
		* Most common in western cultures which cultivate a desire for thinness
		* Teens and young adults
		* Professionals whose weight is related to achievement
	* Possible causes for Anorexia/Bulimia
		* Physiological Causes
			* Malfunction of hypothalamus? **No support**
			* Hormone levels: A type of estrogen may play a role in triggering eating disorders during puberty.
			* Serotonin levels: High serotonin activity associated with anorexia; low serotonin activity related to bulimia (depression is also associated with low serotonin).
		* Psychological Causes
			* Conflict with over protective parents
			* A type of obsessive compulsive disorder
				* Obsessed with food
				* Engage in compulsive behavior to deal with the obsession
			* Fear of the adult world and sexual relationships
			* Perfectionism -> self-hatred -> low self-esteem
			* Societal pressures
	* Treatment for Anorexia and Bulimia
		* Pharmacological Treatments
			* Antipsychotic drugs used to treat compulsive disorder
			* Antidepressants used to treat Bulimia
		* Psychological Treatments
			* Psychotherapy
			* In-patient treatment centers
			* Cognitive behavior therapy to treat Bulimia
