## Stress and Health

* Stress is a physiological and psychological response to an event that threatens or challenges a person
* Health is an example of how the mind and the body interact.

### Sources of Stress

* **Microstressors**: Daily hassles and minor annoyances.
	* Don't necessarily pose a threat to heath, except in highly anxious people and when stress is chronic and uncontrollable. 
* **Conflict**: When a person must choose between contradictory needs, wants, demands, or goals.
	* **Approach-Approach Conflict**: When a person must choose between two *desirable* alternatives. 
		* For example, choosing between favorite food in a restaurant.
	* **Avoidance-Avoidance Conflict**: When a person must choose between two *undesirable* alternatives. 
		* For example, going to the dentist vs. tooth decay. 
		* Not choosing also leads to negative consequences.
		* Often causes people to freeze and not make a decision. 
		* Choosing the lesser of two evils.
	* **Approach-Avoidance Conflict**: When a single activity has both positive and negative aspects (pros and cons).
		* For example, a person on a diet.
		* Can lead to feelings of ambivalence. 
	* **Multiple Approach-Avoidance Conflict**: When one must choose among multiple alternatives, each having positive and negative features.
		* For example, choosing an apartment/university. 
		* People feel ambivalent about each choice and vacillate between alternatives. 
* **Unpredictability and lack of control**
	* Unpredictable stressors are more difficult to cope with than predictable ones.
	* A sense of control over one's life influences stress. Control up, stress down. 
	* A sense of control affects the neuroendocrine and immune system. 
* **Catastrophic Events and Chronic Stress**
	* Catastrophic Events: natural disasters, combat, terrorist attacks, etc. 
	* Chronic Stress: prolonged divorce, chronic physical and emotional abuse, etc. 
	* Can lead to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
		* Include flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive memories and debilitating anxiety. 
		* Young people and women are more vulnerable to PTSD.
		* People with PTSD are more vulnerable to depression, drug and alcohol abuse. 

### Studying Stress

* General Adaptation Syndrome
	* A series of physical response to severe or prolonged stress
	* Occurs in three phases
		* Alarm
			* Sympathetic system mobilizes body to fight or flight
			* Reaction triggered by stress hormones
			* Symptoms of illness
			* Low level of resistance
		* Resistance
			* Body attempts to cope with stressor
			* As defenses balance, symptoms of alarm reaction disappear
			* Outward Symptoms disappear
			* High level of resistance
		* Exhaustion
			* Persistent stress drains body of energy and increases chance of illness
			* Weakest areas of the body are most vulnerable
			* Psychosomatic illness: REAL illnesses brought on by stress
			* Low level of resistance
* Stressful Life Events (Holmes and Rahe)
	* Social Readjustment Rating Scale
		* Measured stress by ranking different life evetns from most to least stressful
		* Life Change Units: numerical value assigned to each event
		* Both + and - life changes are associated with stress
		* Drawback: Doesn't consider appraisal of the situation (interpretation of situation).
* Optimism and Pessimism
	* Optimists expect good outcomes, experience less stress, and live healthier lives
	* Pessimists focus on stressful feelings, experience increased stress, greater illness, and slower recovery from defeats
