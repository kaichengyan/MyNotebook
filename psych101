## History of Psychology and Psychological Perspectives

### Major issues in psych

#### Nature vs Nurture

* Are behavioral diff due to biology or environment?
* Consensus: All behavior depends on both. 
* Genetics -> Potential
* Environment -> Outcome

#### Mind vs Brain

* How are the mind and the brain related? 
* Does the brain produce the mind? 
* Does the mind control the brain?
* Rene Descartes: Interactionism, Seperate, but they interact. Physical change <-> Mental change. 
* Franz Gall: all mental faculties reside in the brain; these faculties are revealed thru contours of the skull. Founder of phrenology (reading personality from the bumps of skull).
* Current view: 
	* The mind is not just the brain. 
	* The mind is not independent from the brain. 

#### Stability vs Change

* How stable are our behaviors and traits?
* Goal: Identify the factors that influence change?
	* Age effects
	* Situational effects

### History and Perspectives

#### Structuralism (Wilhelm Wundt)

* Goals / Emphasis
	* Discover the laws and principles that explain conscious experience.
	* Identify simplest essential unites of the mind.
	* **Introspection**: report experience w/o interpretation. Problem: too subjective. 

#### Functionalism (William James)

* Goals / Emphasis
	* Discover how the mind functions to help us adapt to our env.
	* To study phenomena in real life situation. 

#### Behavioral Perspective (Watson / Skinner)

* Goals / Emphasis
	* Study observable responses and their relation to observable stimuli. 
	* Focus on env factors that cause behavior (i.e., **rewards, punishments**, etc.)
	* Stimulus -> ? -> Response

#### Gestalt Perspective (Wertheimer)

* Goals / Emphasis
	* Must analyze the whole of behavior, not just its elements. 
	* Emphasize the role that **organizational processes** play in perception, thinking and learning. 
	* The relationships among the elements as a whole play an important role in determining our experience. 
	
#### Psychodynamic (psychoanalytic) Perspective (Freud) 

* Goals / Emphasis
	* **Unconscious** mental processes and conflict influence behavior. 
	* Childhood experiences determine adult personality and behavior. 
	
#### Humanistic Perspective (Rogers / Maslow)

* Goals / Emphasis
	* Subjective human experience.
	* Individuals have **free will** and must take responsibility for their choices. 
	* Understand each person as a whole and hlep each person reach his/her fullest potential. 

#### Cognitive Perspective

* Goals / Emphasis
	* Examine internal mental processes and how they influence behavior. 
	* Study how people perceive, learn, remember, speak, think and solve problems. 

#### Neuroscience Perspective

* Goals / Emphasis
	* Every behavior, emotion and thought is caused by a physical event in the brain or nervous system. 
	* Understand the functioning of the brain and nervous system and how they affect behavior. 

## Research Methods

### Steps in the scientific process

1. Identify a question of interest.
2. Gather information and form a **hypothesis** (statement that attempts to describe or explain a behavior). 
3. Test the hypothesis by conducting research. 
4. Analyze data, draw tentative conclusions and report findings. 
5. Build a body of knowledge
	* Generate new hypotheses
	* Build on existing theories
	* Develop new theories

### Descriptive methods

#### Naturalistic observation

Observe behavior in its natural setting w/o attempting to influence or control it. (Hidden cameras, two-sided mirrors, etc.)

* Strength
	* Study behavior in normal setting
	* Behavior is natural and spontaneous
	* The only way to study some phenomena
* Weaknesses
	* Time consuming
	* Can't control the situation
	* Can't determine causation
	* **Observer effect**: People behave differently when they know they're being watched
	* **Observer bias**: Researchers' expectations can cause them to see what they expect to see

#### Survey method

The use of questionnaires and interviews to gather information about people's experiences and attitudes. 

* Strengths
	* Can gather a lot of information in a short amount of time
	* Useful for collecting data that can't be directly observed

 **Representative sample**: a group of participants that accurately represents the larger population that the researcher wishes to describe. 

* Weaknesses
	* Biased sample
	* Can't determine causation
	* People may not be truthful in their answers

#### Correlational research

Determines the degree of relationship between two factors and how well each factor predicts the other. 

 **Correlation coefficient:** the sign indicates the direction, the number indicates the strength. 

* Types of Correlations
	* Positive correlation: variables vary in the same direction. 
	* Negative correlation: variables vary in the opposite direction. 
	* Zero correlation. 

* Misinterpreting correlations
	* Directionality problem: if a causal relationship between the two variables does exist, it could go in either direction. 
	* Third variable problem: a third factor could underlie the relationship of the two factors of interest.

### Experimental Method

Researchers deliberately manipulate certain factors and measure their effects. Experiments are designed to test hypotheses. 

#### Variables in an experiment

A variable is any condition that can be manipulated, controlled, or measured. 

 **Types**: independent (manipulated) and dependent (measured). The DV (effect) depends on the IV (cause). 

 **Operational Definition**: Specify how variables are to be observed and measured. (Quantify)

#### Groups in an experiment

Experimental group: A group of participants who are exposed to different levels of the IV (treatment). 

Control group: A group of participants, similar to the experimental group, who receives the zero value of the IV (not given the treatment). 

Random assignment: Using chance procedures to make sure all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to a group. 

#### Generalizing results

Can only generalize results to the population being represented in the experiment. 
Must replicate experiment using different populations to apply findings to different groups.  

#### Potential problems

* Confounding variables 
* Selection bias (Random assignment minimizes the effects of selection bias) 
* Experimenter expectancy effect: unintended changes in participants behavior due to cues inadvertently given by the experimenter (mitigation: double-blind procedure, neither the experimenter nor participants know who is in what group)
* Placebo effect: when a participant's response to a treatment is due to/her expectations about the treatment rather than to treatment itself (mitigation: placebo: an inert substance or fake treatment used as a control in an experiment)

## Brain and behavior

### Cells of the Nervous System

#### Neurons

Basic building blocks of the nervous system. 

Dendrites -> soma -> axon -> axon terminals.

#### Glia (Glial cells)

* Supply nutrients to neurons (astrocytes)
* Agents of the immune system (Microglia)
* Form myelin that aids neuronal transmission (Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes)


### Nerve Impulse

Nerve potential

* Resting potential +(outside) / -(inside), voltage ~70mV
* Action potential -(outside) / +(inside), sodium channel opens, Na+ come in; after, potassium channel opens, K+ go out. 

**Synapse 突触**: gap between neurons, or neurons and muscles, in which one neuron releases a chemical that either excites or inhibits the next neuron. 

Presynaptic neuron (synaptic vesicles 突触小泡) -> synapse -> postsynaptic neuron. 

Two types of synapses: 

* **Excitatory synapse**: the binding of the neurotransmitter (NT) to the receptor cause positively charge ions to enter the cell. Increases the likelihood of an action potential. 
* **Inhibitory synapse**: the binding of the NT to the receptor causes negatively charged ions to enter the cell and positively charged ions to exit. Decreases the likelihood of an action potential. 

A single neuron may receive input from many synapses. 

NT reabsorption and deactivation. 

* Reuptake: reabsorption of NTs by presynaptic neuron.
* Deactivation: enzymes break down remaining NTs. 

### Major neurotransmitters

* **Acetylcholine 乙酰胆碱**: Found in the CNS and peripheral NS and is involved in: movement, learning and memory, Alzheimer's disease. 
* **Dopamine 多巴胺**: Primary neurotransmitter involved in: reward circuits (food, sex, drugs), fine motor control (Parkinson's disease), cognition/emotion (Schizopherenia). 
* **Norepinephrine 去甲肾上腺素**: Primary neurotransmitter involved in: "fight-or-flight" response, 
* **Serotonin 血清素**: Neurotransmitter involved in: sleep and arousal, appetite regulation, pleasure and pain (too little -> depression). 
* **Endorphins 内啡肽**: produced by pituitary gland and hypothalamus. Natural opiates that are released in response to pain and vigorous exercise. 

**How do drugs alter neurotransmitters?** Neurotransmitters only bind to appropriate receptor. 

**Agonist**: mimics/enhances the activity of a particular NT. 
**Antagonist**: blocks the activity of a particular NT.

### Divisions of the Nervous System

* **Central Nervous System 中枢神经系统** -- brain and spinal cord.
	* Spinal cord -- nerve fibers that transmit info from sense organs, muscles and glands to the brain, and from the brain to the rest of the body. 
	* Brain -- body's main processing system for info.
* **Peripheral Nervous system 边缘神经系统** -- nerves and ganglia.
	* Somatic Nervous System 躯体神经系统 -- carries input from sense organs to the brain (input); from brain/spinal cord to the skeletal muscles (output). 
	* Autonomic Nervous System 自主神经系统 -- controls body's vital/automatic activities and the functioning of the internal organs. 
		* Sympathetic Nervous System 交感神经系统 -- responds to emergencies by activating bodily resources, such as "fight-or-flight response".
		* Parasympathetic Nervous System 副交感神经系统 -- Controls normal body operation; calms body down after an emergency. 

### Structures of the brain

* **Hindbrain 后脑** -- contains the brainstem and cerebellum. 
	* Medulla 延髓 -- controls heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, coughing and swallowing. 
	* Pons 脑桥 -- important in muscle control, sleep regulation, attention, and other vital functions.
	* Cerebellum 小脑 -- controls motor coordination maintains posture, and plays a role in basic learning and memory. 
* **Reticular formation 网状结构** -- controls arousal and attention and screens messages entering the brain. 
* **Midbrain 中脑** -- contains areas involved in some sensory reflexes; helps regulate brain arousal and pain. 
* **Forebrain 前脑** -- contains the most advanced structures. 
	* Thalamus 丘脑 -- receives info from all senses (EXCEPT for smell) and relays it to other parts of the brain. 
	* Hypothalamus 下丘脑 -- controls release of some hormones, influences drive states, helps regulate emotion, body temperature, and sensations of pleasure. 
	* Amygdala 杏仁核 -- involved in emotion: aggression, rage and fear. 
	* Hippocampus 海马体 -- plays a role in memory formation. Damage causes disability to form NEW memory. 
	* Cerebral cortex 大脑皮质 -- perception and higher mental processes

### Cerebral Cortex 

Responsible for higher brain functions 

* sensation and perception
* voluntary muscle control
* complex thought
* reasons
* memory and language

Four lobes

* frontal lobe
* parietal lobe
* occiptal lobe
* temporal lobe 

#### Cortical organization

* Functional specialization -- Different areas of the cortex serve different functions.
* Topographic organization: for sensory/motor areas, adjacent neurons receive input from adjacent portions of sensory/muscle tissue. 
* Contralateral connections: each hemisphere is responsible for sensory/motor control of the opposite side of the body.
